# TensorFlow

I made two simple ML models using Tensorflow datasets:
  1) Using the CIFAR dataset, the model would use deep learning to classify images into 10 different classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
  2) Using the MNIST dataset, the model would use deep learning to classify images into 10 different classes: handwritten digits from 0-9
