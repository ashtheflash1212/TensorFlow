# TensorFlow and Pytorch

I made two simple ML models using Tensorflow datasets:
  1) Using the CIFAR dataset, the model would use deep learning to classify images into 10 different classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
  2) Using the MNIST dataset, the model would use deep learning to classify images into 10 different classes: handwritten digits from 0-9

I also made a simple ML model using a Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jamiewelsh2/nba-player-salaries-2022-23-season
  1) Using several player data including shooting percentage, and advanced metrics, I made a Pytorch model that could predict their salaries.
  2) For fun, I also tried including a RandomForestRegressor
  3) I've concluded that given the high loss, the several variables used to predict salaries might not have correlated well with predicting salaries. Salaries can be unpredictable given any year, and underpaid and overpaid athletes are a real thing.
